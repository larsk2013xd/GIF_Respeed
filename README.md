# GIF ReSpeed
This is a tool that can be used to speed up / slow down .GIF files. This file is meant for GIF89a files (but 87a files will work most of the time as well)

There's not much more to it. I decided to create one because the only other way I found was uploading my gifs to some weird site and having to wait half an hour before I had to download my 60MB gif file again.

# How to use
Simply drag / drop a .gif file onto the program. Indicate the desired framerate. (Hundreths of seconds / frame). Future releases might use FPS instead of hundreths-sec.

# Requirements
This program uses no extra packages besides the default `os`, `path` and `time` packages. Neat isn't it :)
